## Assessment Framework

### EPHPP Domains

The EPHPP tool evaluates six methodological domains relevant to internal validity:

1. **Selection Bias and Representativeness**
2. **Study Design**
3. **Confounders (Baseline Equivalence)**
4. **Blinding**
5. **Data Collection Methods**
6. **Withdrawals and Dropouts**

### Domain Rating Scale

Each domain receives one of three ratings:

- **Strong** : Meets highest quality criteria
- **Moderate** : Meets most criteria with minor limitations
- **Weak** : Fails to meet quality criteria or serious limitations

### Overall Study Quality

Based on domain ratings:

- **Strong**: No weak domain ratings
- **Moderate**: One weak domain rating
- **Weak**: Two or more weak domain ratings

---

## Criteria Definitions

### 1. Selection Bias and Representativeness

#### Strong 
- Participants randomly selected from target population, OR
- Representative sample with >80% participation rate, OR
- Entire eligible population enrolled

#### Moderate 
- Somewhat representative sample (e.g., one school/district), OR
- Participation rate 60-79%, OR
- Reasonable justification for sample selection

#### Weak 
- Convenience sample with limited justification, OR
- Participation rate <60%, OR
- High risk of selection bias

**Educational Context Note**: True random population sampling is rare in educational research. We prioritized internal validity (baseline equivalence) over external validity (representativeness) in this domain.

---

### 2. Study Design

#### Strong 
- Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) with proper randomization procedures
- Random assignment at individual or cluster level
- Adequate description of randomization method

#### Moderate 
- Quasi-experimental design with comparison group
- Matched groups or statistical control for baseline differences
- Pre-post design with concurrent control

#### Weak 
- Single group pre-post without comparison
- Historical controls
- Serious threats to internal validity

---

### 3. Confounders (Baseline Equivalence)

#### Strong 
- Groups equivalent at baseline (RCT with successful randomization), OR
- Controlled for ≥80% of relevant confounds statistically, OR
- Matched designs with comprehensive matching

**Key confounds in educational research:**
- Prior achievement/ability
- Age/grade level
- Socioeconomic status
- Prior instruction/exposure

#### Moderate 
- Controlled for 60-79% of relevant confounds, OR
- Some baseline differences but adjusted in analysis, OR
- Groups similar on most important confounds

#### Weak 
- Not controlled for confounds, OR
- Controlled for <60% of relevant confounds, OR
- Significant baseline differences not addressed

---

### 4. Blinding

#### Strong 
- Outcome assessors AND participants blinded to condition
- Adequate blinding procedures described

#### Moderate 
- Outcome assessors OR participants blinded
- Partial blinding with adequate procedures

#### Weak 
- No blinding, OR
- Blinding attempted but likely broken, OR
- Blinding not feasible and creates potential bias

**Educational Context Note**: Complete blinding is rarely feasible in educational technology research. We rated this domain conservatively, acknowledging that most educational interventions cannot fully blind participants. Studies using objective, standardized assessments administered by blinded raters received higher ratings.

---

### 5. Data Collection Methods

#### Strong 
- Valid and reliable measurement tools (documented psychometric properties)
- Standardized administration procedures
- Trained data collectors

#### Moderate 
- Valid OR reliable tools, OR
- Standardized procedures with minor inconsistencies, OR
- Some psychometric evidence

#### Weak 
- Tools with unknown validity/reliability, OR
- Non-standardized procedures, OR
- Inadequate psychometric information

**Evidence considered:**
- Cronbach's α ≥ 0.70 (preferred ≥ 0.80)
- Prior validation studies cited
- Standardized test vs. researcher-developed
- Inter-rater reliability (if applicable)

---

### 6. Withdrawals and Dropouts

#### Strong 
- Follow-up rate ≥80% (attrition <20%), AND
- Similar attrition across groups (within 5%), AND
- Reasons for withdrawal described

#### Moderate
- Follow-up rate 60-79% (attrition 20-40%), OR
- Differential attrition but reasons explained and acceptable, OR
- ITT (Intention-to-Treat) analysis conducted

#### Weak
- Follow-up rate <60% (attrition >40%), OR
- Differential attrition without explanation, OR
- Attrition likely to bias results

## Sensitivity Analysis by Quality

### Effect Sizes by Overall Quality Rating

| Quality | k | Mean g | Range | 95% CI |
|---------|---|--------|-------|--------|
| Strong | 6 | 0.56 | 0.45-0.68 | [0.42, 0.70] |
| Moderate | 6 | 0.57 | 0.39-0.71 | [0.43, 0.71] |

**Result**: No significant difference in effect sizes by quality rating (Q_M(1) = 0.01, p = 0.92).

### Effect Sizes by Study Design

| Design | k | Mean g | Range | 95% CI |
|--------|---|--------|-------|--------|
| RCT | 4 | 0.59 | 0.45-0.68 | [0.43, 0.75] |
| Quasi-exp | 7 | 0.55 | 0.39-0.71 | [0.40, 0.70] |
| Longitudinal | 1 | 0.48 | - | - |

**Result**: No significant design moderation (Q_M(1) = 0.15, p = 0.70).

### Blinding Sensitivity

| Blinding | k | Mean g | Range |
|----------|---|--------|-------|
| Moderate (partial) | 6 | 0.58 | 0.48-0.68 |
| Weak (none) | 6 | 0.55 | 0.39-0.71 |

**Result**: Blinding did not moderate effects (Q_M(1) = 0.08, p = 0.78), suggesting measurement bias is unlikely.

## Quality Assessment Conclusions

### Strengths of Evidence Base

1. **High methodological quality**: 50% strong, 50% moderate, 0% weak
2. **Validated measures**: 92% used instruments with documented psychometric properties
3. **Minimal attrition**: All studies <20% dropout, well-balanced
4. **Baseline controls**: 83% strong control for confounds
5. **Diverse designs**: Mix of RCTs and quasi-experimental studies

### Limitations

1. **Limited blinding**: Expected in educational technology research but noted
2. **Selection bias potential**: Most used convenience samples (school-based)
3. **External validity**: Representativeness moderate; generalization requires caution

### Impact on Meta-Analysis Conclusions

- **No quality-related heterogeneity**: Effect sizes consistent across quality levels
- **Robust to design**: RCTs and quasi-experimental studies yielded similar effects
- **Minimal bias indicators**: Low blinding did not inflate effects
- **Confidence in conclusions**: High-quality evidence base supports findings

---

## Recommendations for Future Research

Based on quality assessment findings:

1. **Improve blinding**: Use independent, blinded outcome assessors when possible
2. **Expand sampling**: Recruit from more diverse, representative populations
3. **Report procedures**: Provide detailed descriptions of randomization, attrition handling
4. **Psychometric reporting**: Always report reliability; include validity evidence
5. **Follow-up**: Include delayed posttests to assess retention
6. **Intent-to-treat**: Conduct ITT analyses to address attrition bias

## Appendix: EPHPP Tool Modifications

### Original EPHPP Tool

Developed for public health interventions; adapted here for educational technology research.

### Modifications Made

1. **Selection bias**: Emphasized internal over external validity (baseline equivalence prioritized)
2. **Blinding**: Acknowledged practical constraints in education (rated more leniently)
3. **Data collection**: Added education-specific criteria (standardized tests, Cronbach's α)
4. **Context**: Interpreted criteria through lens of school-based research

### Rationale

Educational research contexts differ from clinical trials. Complete blinding and population-representative sampling are often impractical. Our adaptations maintain rigor while recognizing field-specific constraints.
