## Overview

### Purpose

This document provides the standardized protocol used to extract data from included studies. All extractions followed this protocol to ensure consistency and reproducibility.

### Extraction Process

1. **Initial screening**: Two independent reviewers screened titles/abstracts
2. **Full-text review**: Applied detailed eligibility criteria
3. **Data extraction**: Systematic extraction using standardized forms
4. **Consensus**: Discrepancies resolved through discussion
5. **Verification**: All extractions cross-checked against original papers

### Key Principles

- **Prioritization**: When multiple measures available, prioritize validated comprehensive assessments
- **Time points**: Extract immediate posttest; note delayed assessments separately
- **Multiple comparisons**: Each relevant technology vs. control comparison treated as independent effect
- **Missing data**: Document what's missing; no imputation used
- **Clarification**: Contact authors if critical information unclear (none required in this review)

## Coding Rules and Decision Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Stay faithful to authors' descriptions**: Extract what is reported; don't infer
2. **Prioritize primary outcomes**: Use main outcome identified by authors
3. **Document uncertainty**: Note when information is unclear
4. **Consistency**: Apply same rules across all studies

### Specific Decision Rules

#### Technology Classification

**ITS (Intelligent Tutoring System)**:
- Adaptive algorithms that adjust to student responses
- Diagnostic feedback
- Student modeling
- Examples: Cognitive Tutor, AnimalWatch

**AR/VR**:
- Augmented reality overlays
- Virtual reality immersive environments
- 3D spatial interactions
- Examples: AR fraction apps, VR manipulatives

**Pedagogical Framework**:
- Theory-grounded but not primarily technology-driven
- Technology supports but doesn't drive instruction
- Examples: Digital manipulatives with coordinated reps

**Ambiguous cases**: Classify by primary mechanism

#### Duration Calculation

```
Total instructional time = Weeks × Sessions_per_week × Minutes_per_session

If range reported (e.g., "4-6 weeks"):
→ Use midpoint (5 weeks)

If only "approximately X weeks":
→ Use stated value
```

#### Effect Size Selection

**Priority order when multiple outcomes**:
1. Validated standardized test
2. Comprehensive measure (conceptual + procedural)
3. Conceptual understanding alone
4. Procedural fluency alone
5. Single-skill measures

**When outcomes are subscales of same test**:
- Calculate ES for composite/total score if reported
- If not, use subscale most aligned with intervention focus

#### Handling Missing Information

| Missing Data | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| Effect size data (M, SD) | Attempt calculation from t/F/p |
| Effect size data (no statistics) | Contact authors (not needed in this review) |
| Sample sizes | Check for dropout info; use available n |
| Reliability | Note as "Not reported" |
| Duration | Check methods carefully; note as "Unclear" |

#### Quality Assessment Conventions

- **When evidence absent**: Rate conservatively (lower)
- **When partially reported**: Use available information; note limitations
- **When ambiguous**: Discuss with second rater for consensus
