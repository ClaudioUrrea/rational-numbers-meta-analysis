  "title": "Technology-Enhanced Rational Number Learning in K-12 Education: A Meta-Analysis Dataset",
  "description": "Complete replication materials for a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the effectiveness of technology-enhanced interventions for rational number learning in K-12 education. This dataset includes 12 high-quality experimental studies (N = 1,721 students) conducted across 7 countries between 2017-2025. The random-effects meta-analysis revealed a medium-to-large positive effect (Hedge's g = 0.564, 95% CI [0.468, 0.661]) with negligible heterogeneity (I² = 0%), suggesting consistent benefits across diverse technological platforms and educational contexts.\n\nThe repository includes:\n1. Primary dataset with study characteristics and effect sizes (Base_Datos_K12_FINAL.xlsx)\n2. Meta-analysis results with study weights (meta_analysis_results_k12.csv)\n3. Complete R analysis script using metafor package (metaanalysis_k12_UPDATED.R)\n4. Publication-quality forest and funnel plots (PNG format)\n5. Detailed data extraction coding forms and protocols\n6. Quality assessment ratings using EPHPP criteria\n7. Complete database search strategies for 6 databases\n8. Published manuscript (PDF and DOCX formats)\n\nAll materials are provided under CC BY 4.0 license to facilitate replication, verification, and extension of this research. The dataset enables full reproducibility of all reported analyses and provides a foundation for future meta-analytic updates in this domain.",
